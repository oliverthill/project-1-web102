## Notes

Challenge 1: Using props efficienty
I ended up grouping all of the props, but didn't use them for their intended purpose as I just destructured them from the original parameter "props." I will need to go back and look into how the better construct my code to fit the design description.

Challenge 2: Orienting the Events
In the timetabled lab that we did for Unit 1, events were structured into rows to fit the structure of a table for days and times. That didn't seem to work for this project, since they needed to be compartmentalized into different cards to better fit the mobile format and group the information properly. If I were to have used a table format, it would make it much more difficult to organzie the data visually.

Challenge 3: CSS Formatting
It was very difficult to format the cards to have the correct spacing. I had to do a lot of research into CSS documentation to figure out how to group all of the elements properly.
